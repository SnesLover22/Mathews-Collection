<h4 id="discovered-by-catakang-0987">Discovered by Catakang#0987</h4>
<p>This exploit keeps your chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates screwing you over.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <code>chrome://network#state</code> (on your school chromebook of course; if this is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol).</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page; you should see a list of &quot;favorite&quot; wifis that you&#39;ve connected to in the past.</li>
<li>Click the + sign next to the wifi name of each network that you commonly connect your chromebook to.</li>
<li>The more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come from the &quot;favorites&quot; section.</li>
<li>Use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state page.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://caub.glitch.me/">caub.glitch.me</a>/<a href="https://caub4evry1.glitch.me/">caub4evry1.glitch.me</a>.</li>
<li>Paste the copied text into the textbox below.</li>
<li>Press the &quot;generate onc&quot; button below the textbox.</li>
<li>Once you have downloaded the file, go to <code>chrome://network#general</code></li>
<li>Click on the &quot;import onc&quot; button</li>
<li>Import the newly downloaded file</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Extra notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your chromebook will no longer automatically update, as long as you are on a wifi that you used CAUB on.</li>
<li>Be careful not to stay on a WIFI connection for too long without using CAUB on it, otherwise you might update.</li>
<li>This may not work in future updates, or on all WIFI connectiosn</li>
</ul>
